Winter Quarter Classes

CS Classes, Classes

Winter 2022 is officially over! It's been a fun quarter seeing everyone get active on campus again.

I took 4 classes this quarter: CS 111 (Operating Systems), Musicology 68 (The Beatles), LS7B (Genetics, Evolution, and Ecology), and Stats 100A (Probability). What! These courses count towards your CS degree?!? Yes! Music is a GE and LS7B counts towards my tech breadth (TODO: PUT LINK HERE).
