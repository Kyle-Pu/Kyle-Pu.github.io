            <p>Winter 2022 is officially over! It's been a fun quarter seeing everyone get active on campus again.
            <br /><br />    
            I took 4 classes this quarter: CS 111 (Operating Systems), Musicology 68 (The Beatles), LS7B (Genetics, Evolution, and Ecology), and Stats 100A (Probability). What!? These courses count towards your CS degree?!? Yes! Music is a GE and LS7B counts towards my tech breadth (TODO: PUT LINK HERE).
